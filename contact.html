              <span>1.</span>How does crowdfunding work on ResoBridge?
              <p>
                Crowdfunding on ResoBridge allows students and staff to raise
                funds for specific campus projects or needs. To participate:
                <br />
                1. Students/Staff can create a campaign for resources needed.
                <br />
                2. Donors can contribute funds to active campaigns via a secure
                payment gateway. <br />
                3. Once a campaign reaches its goal, the funds are allocated to
                the specified project (e.g., repairing a building or purchasing
                equipment).

              <span>2.</span>How can I donate to a campaign?
              <p>
                To donate to a campaign: <br />
                1. Visit the Crowdfunding page. <br />
                2. Select the active campaign you'd like to support <br />
                3. Choose your donation amount or enter a custom amount. <br />
                4. Select your payment method (e.g., credit card, mobile money,
                or Payaza). <br />
                5. Confirm your donation.

              <span>3.</span>How is the money from crowdfunding managed?
              <p>
                1. The funds raised through campaigns are managed transparently:
                <br />
                2. Each campaign displays a detailed breakdown of how the funds
                will be spent. <br />
                3. Once the goal is reached, the funds are used solely for the
                campaign's stated purpose (e.g., buying materials, paying for
                labor). <br />
                4. Campaign updates and progress reports will be provided
                regularly, allowing donors to see how the funds are being used.
